                Fruit by itself 
                <p>Because like-</p>
                <p>Who serves plain fruit as a genuine desert</p>
                <p>I dont know anybody who does</p>
                <p>But- Apparently people do according the interwebs.</p>
                <p>If its just you or your family, sure, I get that. But some people genuinely serve plain fruit at parties as a desert</p>
                <p>I feel like plain fruit is better as a appitizer or side at things like parties</p>
                <p>Now- If its fruit coverd in chocolate or caramel or something similar. That I get. :D</p>
